# Cooperating ABB robots in simulation

In this repository there are 3 diferent behaviours in order to show the work of two ABB robots cooperating in their software RobotStudio.

## First Behaviour

The robots wait for one another at the _Home_ position and then, start the trajectories.

## Second Behaviour

The robots raise a box and move it around wating for each other at the end of every trajectory.

## Smart Second Behaviour

The same as the second behaviour but using a smart tool.


## Third Behaviour

The robots biuld the first three layers of a jenga tower cooperating and with intermitente trajectories.
